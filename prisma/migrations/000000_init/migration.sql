-- Migration placeholder: Database schema was introspected from Supabase and is managed externally.
-- No SQL is applied here to avoid conflicting with existing tables.

-- If you want a real migration SQL snapshot, run `npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel=prisma/schema.prisma > prisma/migrations/000000_init/migration.sql` locally.
